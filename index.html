			<div class="col-sm-12"><p><b><big>Hello</big></b> my name is Ya Houa Xiong. I was born in a Refugee Camp in Thailand. 
		Growing up in a 3rd world country and in a Refugee Camp, most of the technology we used are still 
		primitive. At the age of 6, My family moved to the United State. I was so fascinated on how big a 
		difference the technology was in U.S compared to the technology I had used in the Refugee Camp. 
		The very first technology in the U.S. I used is a cell phone. When I made my first call on a cell 
		phone, I would question myself how it works. Now I’m currently a student going to school for 
		Networking Administrator & Technologies. The type of work I’m looking for is configuring the 
		network of a big corporation, such as Printer, Computers, Remote Access, Internet connection, 
		Active Directories, Router, Switches, etc. My education has given the experience to be a great 
		networking administrator. In school, my professor will show the class how it works and gave the 
		class a chance to create a network connection our self. Other than school, I enjoy building PC and 
		play video game on my leisure time. So far, I’ve built 3 PC and currently building one more right 
		now. After building the computer I would either sell my PC for money back to build a new PC or give 
		the PC I’ve built to my families or friends. That is a short description of who I am, and I would 
		love to get to know you too.</p>
